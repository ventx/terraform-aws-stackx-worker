about: |
  > Minimal Terraform AWS EKS (K8s) Worker nodes module.
  > Creates simple EKS Managed Node Groups which will be used for stackx or other gitOps components.
  > Uses the optimized and hardened AWS Bottlerocket OS and supports regular x86_64 and ARM_64 architectures.
  > Spot or On-Demand instances can be used but for stackx components ondemand is recommended. -- Part of stackx.

owner: hajowieland

prerequisites:
  - AWS credentials
  - Terraform
  - '[VPC network and subnets](https://github.com/ventx/stackx-terraform-aws-network)'
  - '[EKS Cluster](https://github.com/ventx/stackx-terraform-aws-cluster)'

quickstart: |
  To get started, clone the projects, check all configurable [Inputs](#inputs) and deploy everything with `make`.

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ventx/stackx-terraform-aws-worker.git
  make all # init, validate, plan, apply
  ```

usage: |

  You can run this module in conjunction with other stackx components (recommended) or as single-use (build your own).

  Deployment time around: 10 minutes (with network, cluster, worker)
  ```shell
    make apply 5.81s user 1.12s system 1% cpu 9:57.41 total
  ```

  ### stackx (RECOMMENDED)

  This is just a bare minimum example of how to use the module.
  See all available stackx modules here: https://github.com/ventx


  ```hcl
    module "aws-network" {
      source = "ventx/stackx-network/aws"
    }

    module "aws-cluster" {
      source          = "ventx/stackx-cluster/aws"
      cluster_version = "1.27"
      subnet_ids      = module.aws_network.private_subnet_ids
    }

    module "aws-worker" {
      source          = "ventx/stackx-worker/aws"
      version         = "0.1.0" // Pinned and tested version, generated by {x-release-please-version}
      cluster_name    = module.stackx-cluster.cluster_name
      cluster_version = module.stackx-cluster.cluster_version
      subnet_ids      = module.stackx-network.private_subnet_ids
      vpc_id          = module.stackx-cluster.vpc_id
    }
  ```

  ### Single-Use

  ```hcl
    module "aws-worker" {
      source = "ventx/stackx-worker/aws"
      version     = "0.1.0" // Pinned and tested version, generated by {x-release-please-version}
      cluster_name    = "existing-eks-cluster
      cluster_version = "1.27"
      subnet_ids      = ["subnet-1", "subnet-2", "subnet-3"]
      vpc_id          = "vpc-123456789"
    }
  ```
