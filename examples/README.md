Install [http://localstack.cloud](Localstack) and configure your API-Key to enable Pro APIs:

```bash
 export LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=1234567890
```

and start the Localstack service (in the background) with `make`:

```bash
 make tf-local
```

Try it out:

Now you can run the terratest tests in this [examples/](../examples) directory against your Localstack:

```bash
 make test
```

> 💡**Bonus Tip:** Use `make test-fast` when using Localstack to run tests with more (64) parallel requests than default (16).
